# Kubernetes Up & Runing
Second Edition  

## Example 2.1 (page 17)
On the first example there is not mention of "express" dependency in the _package.json_ file 
and if you don't use Node every day and you just follow the book example you spend half a day to understand why the last command, to run the Docker image, does not work.
